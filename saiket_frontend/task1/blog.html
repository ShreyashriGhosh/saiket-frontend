            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Hey everyone!
                It's exciting to finally launch my first blog post! Today, I want to dive into a few subjects that really spark my curiosity and I'm eager to share them with you.</p>

            <p>"Curiosity is the spark behind the spark of every great idea. The future belongs to the curious."</p>
            <p>How curious are you, really?</p>
            <p>I think most of us like to believe we‚Äôre curious - asking questions and listening carefully - yet what does our genuine curiosity actually look like? curiosity isn‚Äôt just a trait - it‚Äôs a mindset. I also talk through three ideas and questions to help us become even more curious:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>üîç Challenge Our Assumptions: Ask yourself, what if something I think I know about 'this' is wrong?</li>
                <li>üîçSeek Diverse Perspectives: Whose voice or perspective am I missing here?</li>
                <li>üîç Embrace the Unknown: What might I be avoiding because it feels too unfamiliar or uncomfortable?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Curiosity is the key to making our lives more fulfilling, our minds sharper, and our conversations even more meaningful.<br>
                Best wishes for a day filled with curiosity,
                Shreyashri Ghosh
